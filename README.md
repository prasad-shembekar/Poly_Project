FacultyMessenger is a web-based communication platform developed using PHP, designed specifically for enhancing communication among teaching faculty members. This project aims to streamline and simplify communication processes within an educational institution, providing a centralized hub for faculty members to exchange information, collaborate on projects, and stay connected.

The FacultyMessenger project leverages PHP's robust capabilities to create a user-friendly interface where faculty members can log in, access their personalized dashboard, and engage in seamless communication. The system allows teachers to send instant messages, notifications, and announcements to their colleagues or specific groups of faculty members.
